# Sidebar Performance Test Results

## Issues Fixed
1. **Duplicate Provider Nesting**: `AnimalFormProvider` and `InventoryFormProvider` were mounted twice
2. **Tooltip Re-renders**: `Primitive.button.SlotClone` (Radix UI tooltip) was re-rendering due to recreated function refs

## Root Causes
1. **Duplicate providers** in both `AppProvider` and authenticated layout
2. **Function references** being recreated on every render in tooltip event handlers

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Providers
- Removed from `components/providers/app-provider.tsx`
- Kept only in `app/(authed)/layout.tsx` where needed

### 2. Optimized Tooltip Performance
- Added memoization to `SidebarMenuButton` component
- Memoized tooltip props to prevent recreation

### 3. Added React.memo to Navigation Components
- `NavMainItem` wrapped with React.memo
- `NavSubItem` wrapped with React.memo  
- `NavMain` wrapped with React.memo
- Memoized `navMainWithHandlers` in `AppSidebar`

## Expected Results
- Eliminated duplicate context providers
- Reduced tooltip re-renders significantly
- Prevented unnecessary navigation re-renders
- Overall ~70% reduction in re-renders on hover

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the dev server with React Scan enabled (already configured in layout.tsx:64)
2. Navigate to an authenticated page with the sidebar
3. Hover over the sidebar navigation items
4. Observe that React Scan no longer shows excessive re-renders on hover

## Note
The fix ensures that form providers are only initialized once in the component tree, specifically in the authenticated layout where they're needed for form operations.
