## Benefits of This Refactor

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each file has a single, clear responsibility
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Code changes are isolated to specific modules

### 2. **Reusability**
- Custom hooks can be used in other components
- UI components are self-contained
- Utility functions are easily testable

### 3. **Readability**
- No file exceeds 100 lines (vs. original 550+ lines)
- Clear separation between logic and presentation
- Well-organized folder structure

### 4. **Testing**
- Each module can be unit tested independently
- Hooks can be tested with React Testing Library
- Utils are pure functions, easy to test
