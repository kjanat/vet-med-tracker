### ðŸ”§ Remaining Tasks

#### Database Query Type Issues
- [ ] Fix Drizzle ORM transaction type issues in `server/api/routers/regimens-optimized.ts`
- [ ] Resolve Postgres.js vs Neon adapter type differences
- [ ] Fix database query result type mismatches

#### Minor Type Refinements
- [ ] Fix remaining property access errors in components
- [ ] Update outdated test utilities for full type safety
- [ ] Resolve advanced Drizzle ORM type inference issues

## Progress Summary

**Initial State**: 77+ TypeScript errors blocking build
**Current State**: ~8 non-critical type refinements remaining
**Build Status**: âœ… Successfully builds and runs

## Next Steps

1. **Database Adapter Resolution**: Standardize on single database adapter (Neon) to avoid type conflicts
2. **Test Synchronization**: Update remaining test files to match current implementations
3. **Type Refinement**: Address remaining minor type issues during next refactoring cycle

## Notes

- Major blocking errors have been resolved through systematic phased approach
- Project is now development-ready with functional build pipeline
- Remaining issues are technical debt rather than critical blockers
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility and existing functionality
