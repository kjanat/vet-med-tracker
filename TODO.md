# VetMed Tracker - TODO List

## Architecture Analysis Summary
Based on comprehensive analysis (2025-07-31):
- **Database Layer**: 90% complete - schema fully designed, needs migrations
- **Server/API Layer**: 80% complete - tRPC routers implemented, missing some business logic
- **Authentication**: 60% complete - OpenAuth configured, needs frontend integration
- **Frontend**: 70% complete - beautiful UI built, needs backend connections

## Critical Security Issues
- [x] Implement OpenAuth authentication - OpenAuth.js provider configured with mock provider
- [x] Enable authorization checks - householdProcedure middleware implemented in tRPC
- [ ] Fix household ID security - move from headers to secure session/token-based approach
- [ ] Add CSRF protection - implement token validation for all mutations
- [ ] Implement rate limiting - add API endpoint protection against abuse
- [ ] Secure audit logs - add proper access checks for sensitive data

## Database & Backend Issues
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Run database migrations - `pnpm db:push` to create tables
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Create seed data - implement `pnpm db:seed` script
- [ ] Connect tRPC to real database - only `/test-trpc` page currently connected
- [x] Set up database schema - Drizzle schema complete with all entities
- [x] Fix PRN idempotency - adminKey utility implements deterministic keys
- [ ] Add transaction handling - wrap critical operations in database transactions
- [ ] Add database indexes - some indexes exist, need performance analysis
- [x] Configure Neon connection - Drizzle configured with Neon PostgreSQL

## State Management & Performance
- [x] Integrate React Query with tRPC - TRPCProvider configured with React Query
- [ ] Add caching/invalidation strategy - configure React Query for optimal performance
- [ ] Implement code splitting - lazy load routes and heavy components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size - configure tree shaking and analyze imports
- [ ] Add virtualization for long lists - implement react-window for performance
- [ ] Add memoization - cache expensive computations with useMemo/React.memo

## PWA & Offline Issues
- [x] Implement offline queue - useOfflineQueue hook exists with IndexedDB
- [ ] Connect offline queue to tRPC mutations - currently only UI exists
- [ ] Add background sync - implement service worker background sync API
- [x] Set up service worker - sw.js exists in public folder
- [ ] Implement push notifications - connect notification UI to real push service
- [x] Create manifest.json - PWA manifest exists
- [ ] Add service worker update strategy - implement update notifications

## Code Quality & TypeScript
- [ ] Remove all 'any' types - replace 28 instances with proper types
- [x] Enable TypeScript strict mode - tsconfig has strict: true
- [ ] Add error boundaries - implement React error boundaries for graceful failures
- [x] Standardize component patterns - well-organized component structure exists
- [ ] Remove dead code - clean up placeholder.svg and unused imports
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation - document complex functions and components

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Add comprehensive ARIA labels - improve screen reader support
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation - add proper tab order and focus management
- [x] Add loading states - Skeleton components exist, need connection to real data
- [ ] Improve error messages - user-friendly error handling and display
- [ ] Add i18n support - implement internationalization framework
- [x] Improve mobile UX - responsive design implemented with mobile-first approach

## Missing Core Features
- [x] Implement barcode scanning - useBarcodeScanner hook exists
- [ ] Add camera integration - UI exists but needs implementation
- [ ] Implement data export - connect export UI to actual export functionality
- [ ] Build reminder system - backend for notification scheduling
- [x] Complete timezone handling - timezone utilities exist (formatTimeLocal, localDayISO)
- [ ] Add analytics - implement privacy-respecting usage tracking

## Backend Implementation Gaps
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Connect record administration flow to tRPC mutations
- [ ] Implement auto-missed dose creation at cutoff times
- [ ] Add compliance calculation logic
- [ ] Implement inventory depletion tracking
- [ ] Build co-sign workflow for high-risk medications
- [ ] Complete audit logging (TODOs in router code)
- [ ] Implement insights/analytics router

## DevOps & Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline - GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
- [ ] Add env validation - type and validate environment variables with zod
- [ ] Implement monitoring - add Sentry or similar for error tracking
- [ ] Add security headers - CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- [ ] Implement API versioning - version tRPC routes for backward compatibility
- [ ] Create backup strategy - automated database backups
- [x] Configure Vercel deployment - next.config.mjs configured for Vercel

## Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests - test utilities, hooks, and business logic
- [ ] Add integration tests - test API endpoints and database operations
- [ ] Add E2E tests - critical user flows with Playwright
- [ ] Add accessibility tests - automated a11y testing
- [ ] Add performance tests - bundle size and runtime performance monitoring

## Frontend-Backend Connection Status

### Currently Connected (Real Data):
- [x] `/test-trpc` page - demonstrates household CRUD with real database

### Need Connection (Using Mock Data):
- [ ] `/admin/record` - core medication recording functionality
- [ ] `/inventory` - inventory management
- [ ] `/history` - administration history
- [ ] `/insights` - analytics and patterns
- [ ] `/settings` - user and household settings
- [ ] Home page - due medications dashboard

## Immediate Action Items
1. **Database Setup**: Run `pnpm db:push` to create tables
2. **Create Seed Script**: Implement database seeding for development
3. **Connect One Feature**: Start with `/admin/record` as the core feature
4. **Fix Auth Flow**: Ensure authentication works end-to-end
5. **Test Offline Sync**: Verify PWA offline queue with real mutations
