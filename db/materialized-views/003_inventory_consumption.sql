-- Performance hint: This view supports the following query patterns:
-- 1. Inventory reorder alerts (low stock filtering)
-- 2. Consumption forecasting (consumption rate trends)
-- 3. Expiration management (expiring items tracking)
-- 4. Household inventory overview (household_id aggregations)
-- 5. Animal-specific inventory (assigned_animal_id filtering)
