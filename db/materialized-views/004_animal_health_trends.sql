-- Performance hint: This view supports the following query patterns:
-- 1. Animal health dashboard (animal_id filtering)
-- 2. Household health overview (household_id aggregations) 
-- 3. Health trend analysis (month-over-month comparisons)
-- 4. Risk identification (health_status and complexity filtering)
-- 5. Species-based analytics (species grouping)
