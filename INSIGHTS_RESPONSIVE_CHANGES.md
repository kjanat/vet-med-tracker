# Insights Page - Mobile Responsive Refactoring

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Insights Page (`app/(authed)/insights/page.tsx`)

- Added proper container constraints with `min-h-screen bg-background max-w-full overflow-x-hidden`
- Added responsive padding: `p-4 md:p-6`
- Made heading responsive: `text-2xl md:text-3xl` and `text-sm md:text-base`
- Changed grid to mobile-first: `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3`

### 2. Compliance Heatmap Component (`components/insights/compliance-heatmap.tsx`)

- **Fixed the main overflow issue**: Replaced `grid-cols-25` with a responsive grid using `grid-cols-[40px_repeat(24,_1fr)]`
- Wrapped the heatmap in `overflow-x-auto` to allow horizontal scrolling on mobile when needed
- Made filters responsive:
  - Changed to `flex-col sm:flex-row` layout
  - Made select dropdowns full width on mobile: `w-full sm:w-[180px]`
  - Made date button full width on mobile: `w-full sm:w-auto`
- Made legend responsive with `flex-col sm:flex-row` and proper gap handling

### 3. Export Panel Component (`components/insights/export-panel.tsx`)

- Made the export controls responsive:
  - Changed to `flex-col sm:flex-row` layout
  - Made select dropdown full width on mobile: `w-full sm:w-[180px]`
  - Made export button full width on mobile: `w-full sm:w-auto`

## Key Design Patterns Applied

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: All layouts start with mobile (single column) and progressively enhance for larger screens
2. **Container Constraints**: Added `max-w-full overflow-x-hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling on the page level
3. **Responsive Typography**: Used size modifiers like `text-2xl md:text-3xl` for better mobile readability
4. **Flexible Grid Layouts**: Replaced fixed grid columns with responsive alternatives
5. **Touch-Friendly Sizing**: Full-width buttons and inputs on mobile for better touch targets

## Testing

The development server is running at `http://localhost:3000`. To test:

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/insights` in your browser
2. Use browser DevTools to switch to mobile view (Chrome: F12 â†’ Toggle device toolbar)
3. Test at various mobile widths (375px, 390px, 414px)
4. Verify no horizontal scrolling on the page
5. Check that the heatmap is scrollable within its container when needed
6. Confirm all buttons and inputs are properly sized for touch

Alternatively, open the test file at `/test-responsive.html` in a browser to preview different device sizes.
