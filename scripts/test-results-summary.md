- **Purpose**: Stress test with maximum load
- **Expected Behavior**: Graceful degradation, no system failures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Endpoint (`/api/health`)
- **Basic Mode**: System status, uptime, component health
- **Detailed Mode**: Comprehensive metrics including:
  - Database connection health and response times
  - Connection queue statistics
  - Circuit breaker states and metrics
  - Rate limiting status
  - Error tracking

### Alert Thresholds

- Circuit breaker state change notifications
- Queue performance tracking
- Automatic alert detection and logging

## Performance Safeguards

### 1. Connection Queue Management
- **Max Concurrent Connections**: 8 (optimized for Neon free tier)
- **Max Queue Size**: 200 items
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per operation
- **Priority Levels**: 5 levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, BATCH)

### 2. Circuit Breaker Protection
- **Database Circuit Breaker**: 5 failures ‚Üí open for 30 seconds
- **Critical Circuit Breaker**: 3 failures ‚Üí open for 10 seconds
- **Analytics Circuit Breaker**: 8 failures ‚Üí open for 45 seconds
- **Batch Circuit Breaker**: 10 failures ‚Üí open for 60 seconds

### 3. Rate Limiting Policies
- **General API**: 100 requests/minute
- **Authentication**: 5 attempts/15 minutes
- **Medication Recording**: 30 requests/minute
- **Heavy Operations**: 10 requests/minute
- **File Uploads**: 10 uploads/5 minutes

### 4. Adaptive Rate Limiting

  - Connection usage (>80% ‚Üí 50% reduction)
  - Response time (>5s ‚Üí 40% reduction)
  - Error rate (>10% ‚Üí 30% reduction)
  - Never reduces below 10% of base limit
