# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Client Secret
- **Problem**: OpenAuth server was expecting a client secret for the authorization code flow
- **Solution**: Added `OPENAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` to environment variables
- **Note**: The OpenAuth client library doesn't actually use clientSecret in the client configuration

### 2. Token Exchange Failure
- **Problem**: The exchange method was failing due to incorrect handling of the OpenAuth response types
- **Solution**: Updated to properly handle `ExchangeSuccess | ExchangeError` response with `err` property checking

### 3. Infinite 401 Retry Loop
- **Problem**: The `/api/auth/me` endpoint was being called repeatedly when unauthenticated
- **Solution**: 
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Maximum 3 attempts with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Proper cleanup on unmount
  - 401 responses are now treated as expected (not errors)

### 4. Type Safety Issues
- **Problem**: OpenAuth library uses discriminated unions that weren't being handled correctly
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated all verify and exchange calls to check `err` property
  - Fixed subject type inference
  - Handled optional properties properly

## Changes Made

### Environment Configuration
- Added `OPENAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` to `.env.development` (empty, needs to be filled)
- Updated `.env.local.example` to mark client secret as required

### OpenAuth Provider (`server/auth/openauth-provider.ts`)
- Added better error logging throughout
- Fixed exchange method to handle discriminated union response
- Fixed verify method to check for errors
- Made refresh token optional in exchange flow
- Added null checks for user and household creation

### Auth Hooks (`hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added request deduplication to prevent rapid retries
- Added proper cleanup on unmount
- Fixed 401 handling (no longer treated as error)
- Added retry count and last fetch time to state

### Other Fixes
- Updated subjects schema to make householdMemberships optional
- Fixed logout route to use userId instead of non-existent session.id
- Fixed user-menu component to handle edge cases
- Added better error messages in callback route
- Excluded service worker from TypeScript compilation

## Next Steps

1. **Get the actual client secret** from the OpenAuth server at https://auth.kajkowalski.nl
2. **Add it to `.env.development`**: `OPENAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="your-actual-secret"`
3. **Restart the dev server**: `pnpm dev`
4. **Test the auth flow**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Complete authentication on the OpenAuth server
   - Should redirect back and create a user

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login flow works without errors
- [ ] User is created on first login with default household
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Logout clears session properly
- [ ] No infinite retry loops
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
